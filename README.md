# Getting_Cleaning_Data_Final_Project

The run_analysis script downloads the data set from the URL provided in the project description and creates a tidy data set with the averages for each variable. 

The objective is below. 

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Create unique activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
